## Structure of the `data` directory

The data directory contains the raw greenscreen videos in `raw`, images used as real surroundings in `real_backgrounds` and those used as virtual_backgrounds in `virtual_backgrounds`. When the attack pipeline in executed several directories are created in `data`:

- `bg_videos` Videos of a person in its "real" surroundings, without a virtual background. Content is created based on the green screen videos in `data/raw` and the backgrounds in `data/real_backgrounds`.
- `vbg_videos` Videos of a persion with a virtual background that conceals the real surroundings. Content is created based on the videos in `bg_videos` and the backgrounds `data/virtual_backgrounds`.
- `ground_truths_mask` Masks showing the maximum leakage of each background pixel for the videos in `vbg_videos`.
- `ground_truths_color` Images showing the best reconstruction that could be achieved by a perfect attack.
- `greenscreen_masks` Masks created from the green screen videos in `data/raw`.
- `bg_zoom_masks` Zoom masks to replace the real surroundings of a video in `bg_videos` with a virtual background.
- `bg_mp_masks` Masks generated by mediapipe to replace the background with a virtual one for the videos in `bg_videos`.
- `zoom_leak_masks` Leaked pixels per frame for the virtual backgound videos created with Zoom: `bg_zoom_masks` - `greenscreen_masks`.
- `mp_leak_masks` Leaked pixels per frame for the virtual backgound videos created with MediaPipe: `bg_mp_masks` - `greenscreen_masks`.
- `vbg_zoom_masks` Masks generated by re-applying Zoom for the videos with virtual backgrounds in `vbg_videos`.
- `vbg_mp_masks` Masks generated by re-applying MediaPipe for the videos with virtual backgrounds in `vbg_videos`.
- `deeplab_masks` High quality portrait segmentation masks for the videos with virtual background in `vbg_videos`.
- `deltae` Color distance of each pixel in the reconstructed surroundings (`reconstructed`) to the theoretical best reconstruction possible (`ground_truths_color`).
- `vbg_deltae` Cache of the color distance between frames of a video and the reconstructed virtual background. Mainly necessary to speedup the attack for debugging purposes.
- `reconstructed` Images showing the reconstructed surroundings of a caller.
